## Source 1: Percentage of Adult Smokers in California Counties from 2010 to 2019
1. https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/california/2016/downloads
2. The data from this website uses a national survey known as "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System"" (BRFSS). They collected data via telephone interview and has had over 400,000 responses. The data covers many different health behaviors and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) indicators, but for the purposes of our project we will only be considering the data on adult smoking trends. 
3. There are 57 rows that contain data (the three top rows offer information on the categories), which reflect the 57 counties in California that we will study. 
4. There are 49 columns total, but we will most likely only consider the columns that relate to the percentage of smokers for a particular year and county. 
5. From this data, we can answer questions about trends in adult smoking by county and by year.

2. The data that is used inthe CDC website is gathered by compiling information from cancer registeries across the United States, we will only be using the information gathered within the state of California. It is compiled within five year periods andbreaks down the information by varying cancer types and by the counties. 
3. The table provides the population on the county, the types of councers that affect the country, as well as the rate of new cases. 
4. From this data we can see the correlation, if any, between counties in California with high smoking rates and to different cancers.
